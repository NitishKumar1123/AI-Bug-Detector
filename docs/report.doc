**# AI-Powered Bug Detection and Auto-Fix Tool for C++**

## **1. Project Overview**
### **Objective**
This project aims to develop an AI-powered bug detection and auto-fix tool for C++ programs. The tool utilizes **machine learning models** trained on C++ code snippets to classify and detect common bug types (e.g., memory leaks, buffer overflows). It provides **suggested fixes** and features a **command-line interface (CLI)** and **graphical user interface (GUI)** for seamless user interaction.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python (Flask for GUI, PyTorch/Scikit-learn for ML, Clang Static Analyzer for feature extraction)
- **ML Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, or fine-tuned GPT-based models
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for Flask-based GUI)
- **Backend:** Flask API
- **Environment:** Virtual environment with Python 3.12
- **Deployment:** Local Flask server with potential extension to cloud deployment

## **2. Project Workflow**
### **Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Collected C++ code snippets with known bugs from open-source repositories.
- Used Clang Static Analyzer to extract meaningful features (e.g., AST, CFG representations).
- Cleaned and labeled datasets for supervised learning.
- Converted code into vectorized form using **TF-IDF** and **word embeddings**.

### **Step 2: Model Training & Evaluation**
- Implemented multiple models (**Random Forest, XGBoost, fine-tuned GPT**) for bug classification.
- Trained models on labeled data and saved the best-performing model in `models/`.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Saved the trained model and vectorizer for inference.

### **Step 3: CLI Tool Development**
- Developed a command-line tool to analyze C++ files:
  ```sh
  python -m cli.main test.cpp
  ```
- **Example Output:**
  ```
  Bug Type: Memory Leak
  Suggested Fix: delete[] ptr;
  ```
- Ensured lightweight execution with minimal dependencies.

### **Step 4: GUI Development (Flask-Based Web App)**
- Built a Flask-based **web interface** for bug detection.
- Integrated the trained model into Flask backend.
- Designed a simple HTML/CSS interface for file uploads and result visualization.

### **Step 5: Testing & Debugging**
- **Test Cases:** Checked various C++ code snippets for known and unknown bug patterns.
- **Common Errors Fixed:** Jinja2 syntax errors, file path issues, Flask template loading problems.
- Debugged the issue where Jinja2 `{% comment %}` was incorrectly used instead of `{# ... #}`.

### **Step 6: Deployment & Future Enhancements**
- Deployed the tool locally via Flask.
- Future enhancements:
  - Deploy as a **VS Code extension** for real-time bug detection.
  - Integrate with a cloud-based API for scalable performance.
  - Expand bug classification with **deep learning models** for improved accuracy.

## **3. Conclusion**
This AI-powered C++ bug detection tool successfully identifies and suggests fixes for common coding errors. The **CLI and GUI interfaces** provide flexibility for different users, and the ML model ensures intelligent error classification. Future iterations will enhance performance and integrate with IDEs for real-time bug prevention.
